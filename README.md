Project created to check the best way to set a clean integration between [Next.js], [RTK Query] and [Tailwind CSS] and test the Tailwind's scroll snap functionality by cloning a real project.

It's also important to highlight the use of [Atomic Design] for the visual components structure.

I would like to thank [Roberto Sannazzaro] for his "[Tesla Clone in Next js and Tailwind CSS]" video, as it was very useful for the visual part of this project. Thanks Roberto, great job!

One of the best ways to learn and improve is by sharing knowledge, so you can use this project to study and improve. I hope you find it useful!
